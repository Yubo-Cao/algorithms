Hi, other two people who may look at this directory.

I am good at `java.util.regex.*`, `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter`, and basic usage of collections in java,
as demonstrated in this directory. Therefore, feel free to ask me parse any string that may be described by regex. If not, which is unlikely to exists, some dirty work with `Stack<T>` and `Queue<T>` will also make it work out just fine(hopefully).

My algorithm, is weaker. Therefore, consider study some graph/topography/dynamic processing/etc.
