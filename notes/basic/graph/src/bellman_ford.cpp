/**
 * Given a directed graph with n points and m edges, there may be multiple edges
 * and self-loops in the graph, and the edge weight may be negative.
 *
 * Please find the shortest distance from point 1 to point n passing through at
 * most k edges. If it is impossible to go from point 1 to point n, output
 * impossible.
 *
 * Note: There may be negative weight loops in the graph.
 *
 * Input format:
 * - The first line contains three integers n,m,k.
 * - The next m lines, each line contains three integers x, y, z, indicating
 *   that there is a directed edge from point x to point y, and the edge length
 *   is z. The points are numbered from 1âˆ¼n.
 *
 * Output format:
 * - Output an integer representing the shortest distance from point 1 to point
 *   n passing through at most k edges. If there is no path that satisfies the
 *   condition, output impossible.
